# Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional digital version of the Munchkin card game, initially designed for terminal-based gameplay. The game will later include database support, save/load functionality, and a graphical user interface (GUI).

### 1.2 Scope
This project recreates the gameplay experience of the Munchkin card game, including:
- Drawing cards from Door and Treasure decks.
- Managing inventory, combat, and player stats.
- Multiplayer mode for 2â€“6 players.
- Future-proof architecture for additional features like expansions and GUI.

The system will eventually allow for saving/loading game states and a user-friendly interface to extend accessibility and scalability.
